/**
 * Playwright config for theorema-certs dashboard end-to-end tests.
 *
 * The tests drive the dashboard SPA and intercept the only API
 * endpoints they care about (`/api/ledger/integrity`,
 * `/api/ledger/sidecar-forged-ack`, …) via `page.route` so they do
 * not depend on real server state. They only need the Vite SPA to
 * be reachable at `baseURL`.
 *
 * Two ways to run:
 *
 *   1. Local dev — the standard Replit workflow stack is already up
 *      (api-server + theorema-certs), both behind the global proxy
 *      on `localhost:80`. Just:
 *        pnpm --filter @workspace/theorema-certs exec playwright test
 *
 *   2. CI / one-shot — boot an isolated Vite dev server scoped to
 *      this test run, no Replit workflow required. Triggered by
 *      `PLAYWRIGHT_MANAGED_WEB_SERVER=1`:
 *        PLAYWRIGHT_MANAGED_WEB_SERVER=1 \
 *          pnpm --filter @workspace/theorema-certs exec playwright test
 *      Task #149 / `scripts/check-theorema-certs-e2e.sh` uses this
 *      so the validation workflow doesn't have to coordinate with
 *      the long-running dev workflow.

/**
 * Task #165 reclaimed `ledger-sidecar-forged.spec.ts` from this list
 * by rewriting its one flaky case (the "stale checkpoint binding"
 * test) as a synthetic `page.route` mock — the fixture-driven
 * version could never pass deterministically because the API's
 * `buildStatusInner()` unconditionally overwrites
 * `lastOkSidecarStatus = "ok"` on every /integrity call (see the
 * comment block above the test for the full root-cause analysis).
 * `ledger-monitor-suppressed.spec.ts` stays ignored under managed
 * mode: its second + third cases depend on the dashboard's
 * `panel-ledger-alerts` toggle becoming visible, which currently
 * requires real api-server state the managed fixture doesn't seed.
 * Tracked for follow-up; not in scope for the merge-gate
 * stabilisation pass.
