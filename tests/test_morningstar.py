"""Tests that pin the Genesis-seal tamper-evidence guarantees.

These tests assert that:
  * `scripts/check-genesis-seal.py` exits non-zero on byte flips, line
    swaps, and pre-marker insertions in `data/hits.txt`.
  * The unmodified `data/hits.txt` still passes the seal check.
  * `lean_bridge._guard` refuses any rendered Lean text containing
    `axiom `, `sorry`, or `admit ` (defence-in-depth against template
    tampering), and `_genesis_integers` never lifts a non-numeric line
    like `axiom foo` into a generated lemma.
  * `kernel.probe()` aborts (RuntimeError) before any line is appended
    when the Genesis preamble of `data/hits.txt` is tampered.

Run from the repo root: `pytest tests/test_morningstar.py -q`.
