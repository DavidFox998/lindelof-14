# check-theorema-certs-e2e.sh — Run the theorema-certs Playwright suite
# as a CI-style gate.
#
# Task #149: the `ledger-sidecar-forged-ack.spec.ts` end-to-end test
# (task #138) and its siblings under `artifacts/theorema-certs/tests/e2e/`
# previously only ran by hand. This script wraps the suite so the
# `theorema-certs-e2e` validation workflow (in `.replit`) and
# `scripts/post-merge.sh` can run it as a real merge gate, alongside
# `lean-proof` / `kernel-numerics` / `morningstar-tamper`.
#
# Behaviour mirrors `check-lean-proof.sh`:
#
#   * STRICT mode (env `STRICT_E2E_CHECK=1`, set by the CI workflow):
#     missing Chromium browser / system deps is a HARD FAILURE — the
#     check exits non-zero so a future regression in browser availability
#     can never silently pass.
#
#   * Lenient mode (default, e.g. on a fresh local clone with no
#     browsers installed): missing Chromium prints a loud WARN and
#     exits 0 so an unrelated merge isn't blocked just because the
#     contributor's box happens to not have Playwright browsers
#     cached. Once Chromium is present, the suite always runs.
#
# The Playwright config boots an isolated Vite dev server on
# PLAYWRIGHT_MANAGED_PORT (default 23180) when
# PLAYWRIGHT_MANAGED_WEB_SERVER=1, so this script does not require the
# long-running `artifacts/theorema-certs: web` workflow to be up.
