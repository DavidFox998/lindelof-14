# restore-lake-git.sh — Rehydrate the `.git/` directory of every
# vendored Lake dependency under
# `lean-proof-towers/.lake/packages/<pkg>/` from a small committed
# tar archive at `lean-proof-towers/lake-deps/<pkg>.git.tar`.
#
# Why this exists (Task #76, follow-up to Task #66):
#
# The Lake packages (mathlib, batteries, aesop, Qq, proofwidgets,
# importGraph, LeanSearchClient, Cli) need to be real git checkouts
# at the manifest-pinned revisions so that `lake update` and
# `lake exe cache get` can run safely without re-cloning everything
# from scratch. But the outer repo cannot directly commit nested
# `.git/` directories — git treats them as submodule boundaries and
# silently skips them on `git add`. The whole `.lake/` tree is also
# gitignored on top of that. So a snapshot can never carry the
# `.lake/packages/<pkg>/.git/` directories along.
#
# Workaround: each `.git/` is bundled as a single `<pkg>.git.tar`
# under `lean-proof-towers/lake-deps/` (a regular tracked
# directory). At restore time we extract the tar back into
# `.lake/packages/<pkg>/.git/`. Git bundles were rejected because
# the shallow single-commit fetch we use to build them references
# a parent SHA we don't have, which makes both `git fetch
# <bundle> …` and `git clone <bundle>` fail with "Failed to
# traverse parents of commit". A raw tar of `.git/` sidesteps
# git's commit-graph traversal entirely. Total tarball weight is
# ~20 MB (mathlib alone is ~18 MB, every other dep is under 1 MB).
#
# Restore procedure per package:
#   1. If `.git/` already exists and `HEAD` resolves to the
#      manifest-pinned rev, do nothing.
#   2. Otherwise: `rm -rf .git`, `tar -xf <pkg>.git.tar -C <pkg>`,
#      then verify `git rev-parse HEAD` matches the pinned rev.
#
# Idempotent. Safe to call from `scripts/check-towers.sh`,
# `scripts/post-merge.sh`, CI, or by hand.
#
# Hard failure modes (exit non-zero):
#   - `git` or `tar` not on PATH
#   - a tar file is missing for a package whose working tree exists
#   - after restore, `git rev-parse HEAD` does not match the
#     manifest-pinned rev
#   - working tree files missing even though `.git/` is intact
#     (Task #172: `lake build` silently wipes the worktree under
#     `.lake/packages/mathlib/` between builds, leaving `.git/`
#     behind. Detected via `git status --porcelain` reporting `D `
#     deletions; healed with `git checkout -- .` against the
#     vendored objects.)
