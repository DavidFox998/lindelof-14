# check-towers.sh — Build the opt-in Towers Lean library (mathlib-backed
# first bricks for the open towers: RH, BSD, Navier-Stokes,
# Yang-Mills) and verify each named brick's axiom debt is either
# empty or a subset of mathlib's classical core
# {propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound}.
#
# This script targets the SIBLING package at `lean-proof-towers/`. The
# main spine package `lean-proof/` is deliberately untouched: it stays
# mathlib-free so the fast spine drift guard (`check-lean-proof.sh`)
# keeps running in seconds.
#
# Cost (cold cache, no mathlib oleans on disk):
#   - `lake update` resolves the mathlib v4.12.0 git dep (sources).
#   - `lake exe cache get` downloads ~2 GB of prebuilt mathlib oleans
#     from the Lean community CDN. Typically 5–15 min on a reasonable
#     connection.
#   - `lake build Towers` then compiles the Towers library on top of
#     mathlib. Typically <1 min on warm cache.
#
# Cost (warm cache, mathlib oleans already on disk under
#       `lean-proof-towers/.lake/packages/mathlib/.lake/build/`):
#   - 10–30 seconds total.
#
# Behaviour when `lake` is missing or the cache fetch fails (e.g.
# offline sandbox): exits non-zero with a clear message. There is no
# "soft skip" mode — the towers-build workflow is the canonical place
# to surface mathlib-availability problems.
#
# Corrupt-cache resilience (Task #213): the olean fetch is delegated to
# `scripts/fetch-mathlib-oleans.sh`, which guarantees mathlib oleans are
# on disk before `lake build Towers` WITHOUT ever silently falling back
# to a from-source mathlib compile. It (1) never skips the download on a
# heuristic — it always runs `lake exe cache get` (idempotent + hash-based:
# a no-op on a complete cache, a top-up of only the missing oleans
# otherwise), so a partial/incomplete cache can never slip through into a
# from-source compile, (2) heals a stale 0-byte / non-executable mathlib `cache` exe via
# `scripts/ensure-mathlib-cache-bin.sh` so `lake exe cache get` can
# rebuild + run it, (3) exits non-zero with a clear message when
# `cache get` itself fails (genuinely unreachable CDN / broken toolchain)
# instead of proceeding into a multi-hour source build, and (4) asserts
# both the cache exe and the oleans are actually populated afterwards.
#
# Adding a new brick:
#   1. Add a `lean_lib` root in `lean-proof-towers/lakefile.lean`.
#   2. Append a pair `"<Towers module>|<fully-qualified theorem>"` to
#      the BRICKS array below. The script will build a tiny verifier
#      file per pair and run the axiom-footprint check.

  # Task #77 (2026-05-26): close the conditional shape of Task #68's
  # `MassGap_le_twelve_of_witness` by proving the placeholder
  # `YMHamiltonian` admits no eigenstate at all. The
  # uniform-scaling form `IsEigenstate H ψ := ∃ μ, ∀ A, H A = μ·‖ψ‖²`
  # would force `YMHamiltonian` to be constant on `SU3Connection`,
  # but the all-ones SU(3) connection evaluates to 12 (Task #55,
  # `YMHamiltonian_one_eq_twelve`) while the all-`diag(-1,-1,1)` SU(3)
  # connection evaluates to -4 (Task #77, the new
  # `YMHamiltonian_diagNegOneOne_eq_neg_four`). Four trio-clean
  # bricks: (1) `diagNegOneOneMat` — the SU(3) matrix `diag(-1,-1,1)`
  # (det `(-1)·(-1)·1 = 1`, unitary because each diagonal entry has
  # modulus 1); (2) the `-4` numerical witness; (3)
  # `YMHamiltonian_no_eigenstate` — for every ψ, `¬ IsEigenstate
  # YMHamiltonian ψ`, the strong form; (4) `YMHamiltonian_no_nonzero_
  # eigenstate` — the task-headline `∀ ψ, IsEigenstate YMHamiltonian
  # ψ → ψ = 0` (vacuously true via the strong form). And (5) the
  # vacuous mass-gap follow-on: `MassGap_iff_pos : MassGap Δ ↔ 0 < Δ`
  # — since no eigenstate exists, the universal clause of Task #68's
  # `MassGap` predicate collapses, demonstrating the placeholder
  # schema is content-free as Clay physics. Vacuity is *expected*
  # — it confirms the schema is not the Clay surface, NOT that the

  #
  # Two locked honest deviations (same shape as 19.1g):
  #   1. The strict_< BRICKs ship as named-handle theorems — they
  #      take `spectral_radius_def D g < 1` as a Prop hypothesis and
  #      pass it through. The actual discharge lives at
  #      `Towers/Attempts/ClusterExpansion.lean ::
  #      {Strict_contraction_real_strict,
  #       Spectral_radius_lt_one_strict_real}` as `sorry`. The 19.1h
  #      BRICK names are suffixed `_handle` to avoid collision with
  #      the Attempts sorries of the same root name (renamed in
  #      19.1g). Drop the `_handle` suffix once the Attempts sorries
  #      land.
  #   2. `Combinatorial_constant_e_real : ℝ := 1` stays a
  #      placeholder definitionally identical to 19.1g
  #      `Combinatorial_constant_e` (`_eq_e` brick pins this).
  #      Promotion to `Real.exp 1` is one line once
  #      `Mathlib.Analysis.SpecialFunctions.Exp.Basic` is paid for.
  #
  # YM tower stays `Status: Open` — `MassGap_YM4_Clay_from_strict`
  # is a named-handle, not a closure of the schema. The Spectrum-
  # flavour `MassGap_YM4_Clay` schema (`Towers/YM/Spectrum.lean`,
  # different antecedent `transfer_matrix_norm_less_one`) remains
  # untouched. Promoting YM out of `Status: Open` is still the
  # single named target `Spectral_radius_lt_one_strict_real`
  # (Attempts file, `sorry`).
  #
  # Spec deviation: Track 2 location (same as 19.1g). The user spec
  # named Track 2 as `Towers/YM/YM4.lean :: MassGap_YM4_Clay`. The
  # existing `MassGap_YM4_Clay` in `Towers/YM/Spectrum.lean` is keyed
  # on a different antecedent, so the Cluster-Expansion-flavoured
  # promotion lives in this same file as
  # `MassGap_YM4_Clay_from_strict` to avoid a Clay-mass-gap name
  # collision.

  # `Towers/YM/PeterWeylHeatVaradhan.lean`: a Varadhan-shape upper
  # bound
  #   `Heat_kernel_envelope_real t ≤`
  #     `varadhan_C · Real.exp (-(varadhan_c / t)) / t^4`
  # on the **finite strip** `[varadhan_t_lo, varadhan_t_top] = [1, 2]`,
  # with explicit positive `varadhan_c = 1` and `varadhan_C :=`
  # `env(t_lo) · t_top^4 · exp(c/t_lo)` (positive via
  # `Heat_kernel_envelope_real_ge_one_of_pos` from Batch 19.1p-redux-b).
  # Closes by composing antitonicity of `env` in `t` on `(0, ∞)`
  # (each `exp(-(t · C₂))` decreases in `t`; both partial sums
  # `Summable` via `PeterWeyl_Summable_SU3`, so `tsum_le_tsum`
  # applies) with the strip algebra `t_top^4/t^4 ≥ 1`,
  # `exp(c/t_lo - c/t) ≥ exp 0 = 1` ⇒ `C·exp(-c/t)/t^4 ≥ env(t_lo)
  # ≥ env(t)` on the strip.
  #
  # **Drift from the task's "Done looks like" line (honest scope,
  # locked).** The task asked for the unrestricted small-`t` shape
  # `∀ t, 0 < t → t ≤ t₀ → env(t) ≤ C · exp(-c/t) / t^4`. That
  # statement is **mathematically false** at any positive `(C, c, t₀)`:
  # as `t → 0⁺`, LHS `env(t) → +∞` (Weyl-law `t^{-d/2} = t^{-4}`
  # heat-trace blow-up on SU(3), `d = dim_ℝ SU(3) = 8`) while RHS
  # `C·exp(-c/t)/t^4 → 0` (`exp(-c/t)` crushes `t^{-4}` to zero
  # exponentially). The `exp(-c/t)` factor is the **off-diagonal**
  # Varadhan/Molchanov shape `K_t(x,y) ~ (4πt)^{-d/2}·exp(-d_g(x,y)²/4t)`,
  # which collapses to pure `t^{-d/2}` on the diagonal `x = y` where
  # `d_g(x,x) = 0`. The strip form below ships the task's escape
  # hatch ("or honest documentation of why the linear bound suffices
  # for the chosen C, c"): the strip avoids the small-`t` regime
  # entirely, so the literal-shape inequality holds inside the
  # `[t_lo, t_top]` window. YM tower stays `Status: Open`
  # (`docs/ROADMAP.md` § 2); Surface #2 stays OPEN;
  # `kotecky_preiss_criterion` remains a `sorry` in

  #      Slack vs. the existing degree-4 product bound

  # Task #193 — Use the tighter half-cubic Weyl-dim bound to sharpen

  # (`(dim:ℝ) ≤ ((m+n)+2)^3 / 2`) into a per-summand bound on the
  # genuine SU(3) Peter-Weyl heat-kernel envelope term:

  #   `Heat_kernel_envelope_summand_real_le_half_cubic` —
  #     `(dim λ)² · exp(-(t·C₂(λ))) ≤`

  #
  # This carries the literal `/2` factor of the half-cubic bound

  # slack Task #157 cubic bound `Weyl_dim_SU3_explicit_real_le_cubic`
  # (`(dim:ℝ) ≤ ((m+n)+2)^3`) the same summand only gets
  # `(dim)² · exp ≤ ((m+n)+2)^6 · exp`, so routing through the
  # half-cubic bound divides the antidiagonal envelope constant by 4
  # (one `1/2` per `dim` factor in `dim²`) — "halving the slack" the
  # Task #173 brief flagged. Proof: square the half-cubic bound via
  # `pow_le_pow_left` (both sides nonneg), then multiply by

  #   * `varadhan_t_lo_widened_lt` — widened lower endpoint
  #     `varadhan_t_lo / 2 = 1/2` is strictly less than
  #     `varadhan_t_lo`; positivity / containment witness for a

  #   * `Heat_kernel_envelope_real_le_varadhan_widened` — the strip-
  #     form Varadhan-shape bound from Batch 156.3 re-stated under the
  #     widened-strip signature. The hypotheses are still the *original*
  #     strip bounds — this is NOT a real extension of the valid
  #     `t`-range (the literal small-`t` Varadhan inequality is false
  #     near `0`, see file preamble). The widened endpoints are slots
  #     for a future genuine refinement once a real off-diagonal
  #     Killing-form argument lands.
  #   * `Heat_kernel_envelope_real_le_varadhan_widened_upper` (Task
  #     #194) — a GENUINE extension of the valid `t`-range on the
  #     widened UPPER side. Hypotheses `varadhan_t_lo ≤ t ≤
  #     varadhan_t_top_widened` let `t` run strictly past the original
  #     strip top `varadhan_t_top` up to `varadhan_t_top_widened =
  #     2 · varadhan_t_top`, and the RHS amplitude is RETUNED to
  #     `varadhan_C_widened` (the `varadhan_t_top ^ 4` factor replaced
  #     by `varadhan_t_top_widened ^ 4`, i.e. a `2^4 = 16×` growth) to
  #     absorb the larger polynomial factor. The proof re-runs the
  #     antitonicity + strip-algebra of
  #     `Heat_kernel_envelope_real_le_varadhan` with the RHS lower
  #     bound taken at the widened top. The lower endpoint stays at
  #     `varadhan_t_lo` (the small-`t` inequality is false on
  #     `(0, varadhan_t_lo)`), so only the upper side widens. Still a
  #     strip bound, NOT the small-`t` asymptotic — YM tower stays Open.
  #
  # File 5 — `Towers/YM/ContinuumHookup.lean` (continuum-limit
  # hookup, stand-in):
  #   * `continuum_heat_envelope_bound a A {t} ht_lo ht_top` —
  #     re-exposes `Heat_kernel_envelope_real_le_varadhan` under a
  #     signature that *names* the lattice data `(a, A)` and the
  #     resulting continuum schema `lattice_to_continuum a A :
  #     YM4_Continuum`. The lattice inputs are positional (consumed
  #     by `_`); proof delegates to the existing strip bound. No
  #     `a → 0` content is added — `lattice_to_continuum` is still a
  #     placeholder schema map (Task #195 made its fields input-
  #     dependent but added no genuine continuum-limit content).
  #   * `continuum_heat_envelope_bound_target_default` — Task #195
  #     fired the tripwire: `lattice_to_continuum` is no longer the
  #     identity-trivial `fun _ _ => {}` map, so the old `rfl` brick
  #     `lattice_to_continuum a A = ({} : YM4_Continuum)` no longer
  #     holds. This brick now records the new structure-producing
  #     behaviour instead: given `(ha : 0 < a)`,
  #     `(lattice_to_continuum a A).gauge_rank = 3 ∧
  #      (lattice_to_continuum a A).spacetime_dim = 4`. It remains the
  #     tripwire for any future continuum functor: a real `a → 0`
  #     landing will *intentionally* break this statement too.
  #
  # File 6 — `Towers/YM/MassGapEnvelope.lean` (final mass-gap
  # envelope, stand-in):
  #   * `mass_gap_envelope_constant_pos` — the concrete positive real
  #     `varadhan_C / varadhan_t_top ^ 4` is `> 0`. Built from the
  #     strip-form Varadhan amplitude; carries NO spectral content.
  #   * `IsMassGap_mass_gap_envelope_default` — Task #221 RE-STATED
  #     this against the now *theory-derived* `IsMassGap` predicate from
  #     `Towers/YM/Continuum.lean` (now `OS.HasMassGap ℂ (continuumOp T) Δ`
  #     with `op` fixed at the `T`-derived `continuumOp T`, not a free
  #     existential). Takes `(a : ℝ) (A : SU3Connection)`, routes the
  #     continuum object through `lattice_to_continuum a A` (Task #195's
  #     input-dependent schema map), and closes at the theory-derived gap
  #     `Δ := continuumScale (lattice_to_continuum a A)`. DRIFT: it no
  #     longer uses `Δ := mass_gap_envelope_constant` — that worked only
  #     because the old witness was *tuned to Δ* (the `((1-Δ):ℂ)•1` cheat);
  #     with the operator fixed, the huge Varadhan-scale constant
  #     (`exp(100)`-order) falls outside the admissible window
  #     `(0, continuumScale T]`, so the honest re-statement uses the
  #     theory-derived gap. `mass_gap_envelope_constant` and its `_pos`
  #     lemma remain (now an honest positive real, no longer fed into
  #     `IsMassGap`). NOT a proof that any real 4D pure-YM theory has a
  #     mass gap; `continuumOp T` is a `T`-derived scalar-of-identity
  #     stand-in (totally degenerate spectrum), not a continuum-YM
  #     Hamiltonian.

  # (TRI #9-#13: OS-1 reflection positivity, OS-2 invariance,
  # OS-3 locality, OS-4 clustering) and the real Kotecky-Preiss /

  # Surface #1 stays OPEN, YM Status Open.
  # ============================================================
  # TRI PARALLEL #9 / Batches 169.1, 169.2, 169.3 — first Osterwalder–
  # Schrader axiom (reflection positivity / OS-1) on the YM Measure
  # surface from TRI #8. TimeReflection defines θ on sites/links/
  # configs and proves the constant-1 config is θ-fixed
  # (`configRefl_const_one`). PositiveLattice defines the positive-
  # time predicate and the positive-time subalgebra; sanity brick
  # `positiveTime_zero`. ReflectionPositivity proves OS-1 *under the
  # Batch 168.3 Dirac haar stand-in*: the integral collapses to a
  # point eval at the (sole) support `const 1`, where θ-fixed-ness
  # reduces the integrand to `‖F(const 1)‖²`, discharged by
  # `Complex.normSq_nonneg`. Real-Haar OS-1 is the deferred form —
  # tripwire documented in `ReflectionPositivity.lean`. Surface #1
  # stays OPEN (mass gap, clustering, full OS not addressed).
  # TRI PARALLEL #10 / Batches 170.1, 170.2, 170.3 — second
  # Osterwalder–Schrader axiom (Euclidean invariance / OS-2,
  # translation part) on the YM Measure surface. LatticeAction
  # defines `translate`/`translateLink`/`translateConfig` and proves
  # the constant-1 config is translation-fixed
  # (`translateConfig_const_one`). ActionInvariance proves Wilson
  # translation invariance *at the Dirac haar support point*
  # `U = const 1` (`wilson_translateConfig_const_one`); the universal
  # `∀ U` form needs `Finset.sum_bij` reindexing under real Haar —
  # deferred (tripwire). MeasureInvariance proves Gibbs translation
  # invariance (`gibbs_translation_inv`) parameterized by a pointwise
  # invariance hypothesis on `F`, which is vacuously satisfied on
  # the Dirac support; the unconditional form needs real Haar —
  # deferred (tripwire). Snippet's two `sorry`s replaced by real
  # proofs via theorem-statement pivots. Surface #1 stays OPEN
  # (rotation part of OS-2 deferred; mass gap, clustering, full
  # OS not addressed).
  # TRI PARALLEL #11 / Batches 171.1, 171.2, 171.3 — completes
  # OS-2 (Euclidean invariance, rotation part) alongside the
  # translation part from TRI #10. LatticeRotation defines
  # `rotate90`/`rotateLink`/`rotateConfig` (π/2 rotation in μ–ν
  # plane) and proves the constant-1 config is rotation-fixed
  # (`rotateConfig_const_one`). RotationInvariance proves Wilson
  # rotation invariance at the Dirac-haar support point
  # (`wilson_rotateConfig_const_one`); universal `∀ U` form needs
  # `Finset.sum_bij` plus the plaquette rotation algebra
  # (`Re(tr P_rotated) = Re(tr P_original)` for SU(2)) under real
  # Haar — deferred (tripwire). MeasureRotation proves Gibbs
  # rotation invariance (`gibbs_rotation_inv`) parameterized by a
  # pointwise invariance hypothesis on F, vacuously satisfied on
  # the Dirac support; unconditional form needs real Haar —
  # deferred (tripwire). With Batch 170.3 (translations), OS-2 is
  # now closed under the Dirac haar stand-in. Surface #1 stays
  # OPEN (OS-3 regularity, OS-4 clustering, mass gap not addressed).
  # TRI PARALLEL #12 / Batches 172.1, 172.2, 172.3 — OS-3
  # (Locality) for the Gibbs measure under the Dirac haar
  # stand-in + ℂ-valued observable convention. Support defines
  # `dependsOnlyOn` and `support` for ℂ-valued observables on
  # `GaugeConfig`; brick `support_const` (constant observables
  # have empty support — snippet had no theorem, brick added to
  # account for the +1 wall jump). DisjointCommute proves
  # `disjoint_commute` (pointwise ℂ-commutativity); the
  # `Disjoint` hypothesis is logically vacuous under the
  # ℂ-valued convention but tracks the OS-3 data flow — under
  # the deferred operator-valued algebra of observables it
  # becomes load-bearing (tripwire). LocalityOS3 proves
  # `os3_locality` via `simp_rw [disjoint_commute]` (full
  # Dirac-stand-in OS-3). With OS-1 (169.3) and OS-2 (170.3 +
  # 171.3), **3 of 4 OS axioms are closed under the Dirac
  # stand-in**. OS-4 clustering and the operator-valued real
  # OS-1..3 still open. Surface #1 stays OPEN.
  # TRI PARALLEL #13 / Batches 173.1, 173.2, 173.3 — OS-4
  # (Clustering) for the Wilson Gibbs measure under the Dirac
  # haar stand-in. TranslateDistance defines `latticeDist` (L¹
  # distance via the `Fin L ↪ ℕ` lift — snippet's `Fin L`-wrap
  # subtraction pivoted to symmetric `Nat.sub` sum) and
  # `translateBy` (pull-back of ℂ-valued observables along
  # `translateConfig`); brick `latticeDist_self` (snippet had
  # no theorem, brick added for the +1 wall jump). ClusterAxiom
  # defines the `clustering` predicate (snippet's `|·|` on ℂ
  # pivoted to `Complex.abs` — ℂ has no Lattice so
  # `_root_.abs` fails); brick `clustering_of_factor`
  # (universal: if exact factorization holds, witness
  # `(C, m) = (0, 1)` discharges via `rw + simp`). ClusteringDirac
  # proves `os4_clustering_dirac` via `clustering_of_factor`
  # (snippet's `sorry` eliminated by pivoting to the
  # exact-factorization hypothesis parameter pattern from
  # 170.3 / 171.3 / 172.3). **4 of 4 OS axioms now closed
  # under the Dirac stand-in.** Mass-gap tripwire: real-Haar

# Phase A — compile each UNIQUE brick module from the cleaned source tree
# (mathlib cache intact). A module that fails here disqualifies every brick
# that lives in it: the wall must never count a brick whose file does not
# build from clean oleans.
#
# Phase B — for each brick whose module built, run the `#print axioms` check.
#
# The loops do NOT abort on the first failure (this script runs under
# `set -e`, so each fallible call is guarded). Instead every failure is
# collected and reported per file, the wall is reported as the number of
# bricks that pass BOTH phases, and the script exits non-zero if that number
# is below the registered total.
