"""At-rest integrity guard for data/hits.txt.

Complements scripts/check-genesis-seal.py (which only covers the
9-line preamble). The Genesis seal cannot detect a stray
`HITS.write_text(...)` or `> data/hits.txt` that wipes the body of the
ledger, because such a rewrite either kills the preamble (caught by
the seal) OR keeps the preamble and silently drops 20k probe lines
(not caught by anything until the next probe fails). Task #53.

The companion file data/hits.txt.checkpoint stores "<size> <sha256>"
of the last known-good ledger state, updated atomically by
kernel._append_line and scripts/seal-birth.py after every legitimate
append. Because the ledger is strictly append-only, any legitimate
growth above `size` still validates against the recorded prefix SHA
— a stale checkpoint is safe; only a *shrunken* or *in-place
rewritten* file is a tamper.

Exits 0 if:
  - data/hits.txt.checkpoint exists and is well-formed,
  - the live ledger is at least as long as the checkpoint records,
  - SHA-256 of the live ledger's first `size` bytes matches the
    recorded hash,
  - the Genesis preamble seal still verifies (defence in depth).

Exits 2 on any of:
  - checkpoint missing or malformed,
  - live ledger shorter than checkpoint (TRUNCATION / REWRITE),
  - prefix-SHA mismatch (IN-PLACE REWRITE),
  - Genesis seal mismatch.

Recovery recipe lives in docs/REPRODUCE.md.
