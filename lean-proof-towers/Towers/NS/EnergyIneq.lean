  # Towers.NS.EnergyIneq

  **Schema file plus three trivial bricks (Task #56, 2026-05-26).**
  This file pins the Clay 3D incompressible Navier-Stokes global
  regularity conjecture as a future formalisation target, using a
  structured (rather than single-`sorry`) schema. As of Task #56 it
  also carries three trio-clean bricks (`H1Norm_zero`,
  `HasFiniteEnergy_zero`, `H1Norm_nonneg`) that exercise the schema
  defs concretized in Task #51. As of Task #51
  (2026-05-26) the two previously `sorry`-backed schema defs
  (`H1Norm`, `HasFiniteEnergy`) have been replaced by concrete,
  minimal, mathlib-backed stand-ins, so the file is now
  `sorry`-free. mathlib v4.12.0 still ships none of the prerequisite
  PDE machinery (Sobolev spaces, Leray-Hopf weak solutions,
  divergence-free L² constraint, energy inequality); the new
  defs are honest placeholders, not the real PDE quantities.

  Because no body is `sorry` any more, `#print axioms
  NS_global_regular_statement` no longer displays `[sorryAx]`. The
  statement type-checks, but its *content* is the placeholder
  schema below, not the Clay conjecture.

  ## Deviations from Plan #51 literal spec

  Plan #51 as written contains an import and an identifier that do
  not exist in mathlib v4.12.0, and a structure-field syntax that is
  not valid in Lean 4. The following deviations were forced:

    1. `import Mathlib.Analysis.Distribution.SobolevSpace` **OMITTED.**
       This file does not exist in mathlib v4.12.0. The closest
       available is `Mathlib.Analysis.FunctionalSpaces.SobolevInequality`,
       which provides the Gagliardo-Nirenberg-Sobolev *inequality* on
       `Lp`, not an `H^k` vector-field Sobolev space type with a
       `.norm` lookup. The TODO on `H1Norm` still names the intended
       future definition.
    2. `import Mathlib.Analysis.Calculus.ContDiff.Defs` **ADDED** (not
       in Plan #51) so that `ContDiff ℝ ⊤ (S.u t)` in the global-
       regularity statement elaborates. Also `Mathlib.Analysis.
       InnerProductSpace.PiL2` for `EuclideanSpace`.
    3. `HasFiniteEnergy` was used in Plan #51 but was deleted from
       `Towers/NS/Divergence.lean` in the previous step (when we
       stripped the placeholder axioms). Added back **here** as a
       local `def := sorry` so this file is self-contained.
    4. `VelocityField` declared as **`abbrev`** rather than `def`, so
       `S.u t` (where `S.u : VelocityField`) reduces to a function
       application on `EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin 3) → EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin 3)`
       without `@[reducible]` annotations elsewhere.
    5. Structure-field syntax `h_div_free : sorry` is **not** valid
       Lean 4 — a structure field's right-hand side after the colon
       must be a type, not a term. Replaced with `h_div_free : Prop`
       (an opaque proposition field) plus a docstring TODO naming the
       intended constraint. The semantic effect is identical: the
       proposition is left abstract, just at the field-type level
       rather than via a sorry-value default.
    6. `∞` (used as `ContDiff ℝ ∞ ...`) is replaced with `⊤`, which
       is the canonical mathlib spelling of "infinitely smooth" in
       `WithTop ℕ` and avoids notation-scope issues.

  ## What this file is NOT

  * Not a proof of NS global regularity.
  * Not a precise Lean statement (placeholders are opaque).
  * **Not a brick.** `scripts/check-towers.sh` explicitly excludes
    this file from `BRICKS`. The 7 real bricks (`divergence_add`,
    `divergence_smul`, etc.) do NOT import this file, so their axiom
    footprints remain in `{propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound}` —
    verified post-build.

  ## What this file IS

  * Stable citable Lean identifiers
    (`TheoremaAureum.Towers.NS.LeraySolution`,
    `TheoremaAureum.Towers.NS.NS_global_regular_statement`) that
    future plans can point to as the future target.
  * A flagged TODO surface — every `sorry` is paired with a `TODO:`
    naming the mathlib gap.

  **Task #51 implementation note (2026-05-26).** The two schema
  defs below (`H1Norm`, `HasFiniteEnergy`) were previously
  `sorry`-backed placeholders, paired with an audit comment that
  declined every candidate mathlib replacement as either a
  disguised stub or a "substantively misleading" Clay-conjecture
  impersonation. Per Task #51, that policy is reversed: each def
  is now a concrete, minimal, mathlib-backed stand-in:

    * `H1Norm u t := ‖u t 0‖` — the Euclidean norm of the velocity
      field evaluated at the spatial origin at time `t`. Real-
      valued, depends on both `u` and `t`. Not the H¹ Sobolev norm.
    * `HasFiniteEnergy u₀ := ∃ M : ℝ, ∀ x, ‖u₀ 0 x‖ ≤ M` — bounded
      amplitude of `u₀` at time `0`. Real predicate. Not the
      L² energy bound `‖u₀(0,·)‖_{L²} < ∞`.

  These let `NS_global_regular_statement` type-check without
  `sorryAx`. The Navier-Stokes tower remains Open per

  ## Task #56 (2026-05-26) — first load-bearing bricks on the
  concretized NS energy schema.

  The three theorems below exercise `H1Norm` and `HasFiniteEnergy`
  (Task #51 concretizations). They are the NS analogue of YM's
  `IsEigenstate_zero_zero`: minimal demonstrations that the
  post-refactor schema defs are real, usable mathlib-flavoured
  surfaces rather than opaque `sorry`-defs.

  **Honest scoping reminder.** None of these advance the NS tower
  past `Status: Open` (see `docs/ROADMAP.md` § 3). They prove only
  that the *placeholder* `H1Norm` (Euclidean norm at the origin) and
  *placeholder* `HasFiniteEnergy` (bounded amplitude at `t = 0`) have
  the trivial expected behaviour on the zero velocity field, and that
  the placeholder `H1Norm` is nonneg. They are NOT statements about
  the H¹ Sobolev norm, the L² energy bound, or any Leray-Hopf
  solution.

  theorem must be either axiom-free or use only the classical trio
  `{propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound}`.

  ## Task #62 (2026-05-26) — second wave of NS energy schema bricks.

  Three more trio-clean bricks on the Task #51 NS schema, each
  referencing `H1Norm` / `HasFiniteEnergy` on *non-zero* / fully-
  general inputs (not just the zero velocity field). This is the
  NS analogue of YM Task #55's wave that proved
  `YMHamiltonian_one_eq_twelve` and friends.

    * `H1Norm_eq_norm_apply_zero` — the named unfolder
      `H1Norm u t = ‖u t 0‖` for any `u`, `t`.
    * `HasFiniteEnergy_of_bounded_zero` — given a uniform bound
      `∀ x, ‖u₀ 0 x‖ ≤ M`, conclude `HasFiniteEnergy u₀`. Real
      hypothesis, not vacuous.
    * `HasFiniteEnergy_const` — every constant-in-spacetime
      velocity field `(fun _ _ => c)` has finite placeholder energy,
      with explicit witness `M = ‖c‖`. References a non-zero input.

  **Honest scoping reminder.** None of these advance the NS tower
  past `Status: Open` (see `docs/ROADMAP.md` § 3). They are not
  statements about the H¹ Sobolev norm, the L² energy bound, or
  any Leray-Hopf solution; they prove only that the *placeholder*
  `H1Norm` (Euclidean norm at the origin) and *placeholder*
  `HasFiniteEnergy` (bounded amplitude at `t = 0`) have the
  expected algebraic behaviour across all velocity fields.

  ## Task #69 (2026-05-26) — combinator bricks on the NS energy schema.

  Two non-trivial combinators on the Task #51 `HasFiniteEnergy`
  placeholder, neither specialised to a constant or zero velocity
  field. They are the NS analogue of YM Task #61's
  `YMHamiltonian_abs_le_twelve`: actual *combinators* on the schema
  rather than unfolders/instantiations.

    * `HasFiniteEnergy_add` — pointwise sum of two finite-energy
      velocity fields is finite-energy. Witness `M₁ + M₂` via the
      triangle inequality `‖u 0 x + v 0 x‖ ≤ ‖u 0 x‖ + ‖v 0 x‖`.
    * `HasFiniteEnergy_of_smul_bounded` — for any scalar profile
      `f : ℝ³ → ℝ` bounded by 1 in absolute value and any fixed
      vector `c`, the smoothly varying field
      `fun _ x => f x • c` has finite placeholder energy with
      witness `M = ‖c‖`. The input `f` is genuinely non-constant
      (any bounded ℝ³ → ℝ profile works), so this is the first
      brick that exercises `HasFiniteEnergy` on a smoothly-varying
      field rather than a constant.

  **Honest scoping reminder.** None of these advance the NS tower
  past `Status: Open` (see `docs/ROADMAP.md` § 3). They are not
  statements about the H¹ Sobolev norm, the L² energy bound, or
  any Leray-Hopf solution; they prove only that the *placeholder*
  `HasFiniteEnergy` (bounded amplitude at `t = 0`) is closed under
  pointwise addition and is satisfied by `‖f‖_∞ ≤ 1`-bounded
  scalar profiles times a fixed vector.

  ## Task #70 (2026-05-26) — name the "energy never grows" predicate.

  The `LeraySolution` structure carries a bare-`Prop` field
  `h_energy` whose docstring TODO names the intended constraint
  `∀ t, H1Norm u t ≤ H1Norm u₀ 0`. Task #62 made `H1Norm`
  load-bearing on arbitrary inputs, so this batch upgrades that
  intention to an actual named predicate, `EnergyMonotone u u₀`,
  on `(VelocityField, VelocityField)`. The structure field
  `h_energy : Prop` is intentionally **left as-is** — flipping its
  type to `EnergyMonotone S.u u₀` would change the structure's
  shape and break every existing `LeraySolution` constructor in
  the codebase (and, more importantly, would make
  `LeraySolution` carry a real, currently-unprovable energy
  constraint without any of the supporting PDE machinery). The
  predicate is exposed as a standalone `def` an external reader
  can `#check` and that future plans can point to.

    * `EnergyMonotone u u₀ : Prop` — `∀ t, H1Norm u t ≤ H1Norm u₀ 0`,
      the explicit placeholder-flavoured energy inequality.
    * `EnergyMonotone_refl u₀` — `EnergyMonotone u₀ u₀` via `le_refl`,
      trivial witness on the diagonal.
    * `EnergyMonotone_zero u₀` — `EnergyMonotone 0 u₀` via
      `H1Norm_zero` + `H1Norm_nonneg`, the second trivial witness
      that exercises the Task #56 brick `H1Norm_zero` and the
      Task #56 brick `H1Norm_nonneg`.

  **Honest scoping reminder.** This brick does NOT advance the NS
  tower past `Status: Open` (see `docs/ROADMAP.md` § 3). It is
  **not** the Leray-Hopf energy inequality. `H1Norm` is the
  Task #51 placeholder (Euclidean norm of `u t 0`), not the real
  H¹ Sobolev norm. The predicate `EnergyMonotone` is therefore a
  placeholder-flavoured pointwise-at-the-origin monotonicity, not
  an L² / H¹ energy bound.

    *diagonal* shape `EnergyMonotone u₀ u₀` reduces (after
    unfolding) to `∀ t, H1Norm u₀ t ≤ H1Norm u₀ 0`, which is
    again non-trivial. So the genuinely trivial witness is at the
    *constant* level: any `u₀` whose `H1Norm` is constant in `t`
    satisfies `EnergyMonotone u₀ u₀` by `le_refl`. We do NOT

  ## Task #78 (2026-05-26) — spatial-translation invariance of the
  placeholder finite-energy predicate.

  Continues the Task #69 combinator wave on `HasFiniteEnergy`. Where
  Task #69 proved closure under pointwise addition
  (`HasFiniteEnergy_add`) and under a `‖f‖_∞ ≤ 1`-bounded scalar
  profile times a fixed vector (`HasFiniteEnergy_of_smul_bounded`),
  this brick proves closure under **rigid spatial translation**: if
  `u₀` has finite placeholder energy with witness `M`, then so does
  the shifted field `fun t x => u₀ t (x + a)` for any fixed
  translation `a : ℝ³`, reusing the same witness `M`.

  This is the first NS combinator that looks like a real PDE
  symmetry (`u₀ ↦ u₀(·, · + a)`) rather than a pure norm-algebra
  fact (triangle inequality / homogeneity of `‖·‖`). The proof is
  one line: for every spatial point `x`, `‖u₀ 0 (x + a)‖ ≤ M`
  follows immediately from `hMu (x + a)`.

  **Honest scoping reminder.** This does NOT advance the NS tower
  past `Status: Open` (see `docs/ROADMAP.md` § 3). `HasFiniteEnergy`
  is still the Task #51 placeholder (bounded amplitude at `t = 0`),
  not the L² energy bound. Translation invariance of the
  *placeholder* predicate is not translation invariance of the real
  energy. The brick exercises real PDE-flavoured surface vocabulary
  on a placeholder schema, nothing more.

  ## Task #89 (2026-05-26) — rotational invariance of the placeholder
  finite-energy predicate.

  Continues the Task #78 PDE-symmetry wave on `HasFiniteEnergy`. Where
  Task #78 proved closure under rigid spatial translation
  (`HasFiniteEnergy_translate`), this brick proves closure under
  **rigid spatial rotation**: composing the velocity field with any
  linear isometry `R : EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin 3) →ₗᵢ[ℝ]
  EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin 3)` on the spatial argument preserves the
  placeholder finite-energy witness with the *same* `M`. Together
  with Task #78, this pushes the schema toward the full Euclidean
  symmetry group on ℝ³ (translations + SO(3)) without leaving the
  placeholder regime.

  The proof is one line: for every spatial point `x`,
  `‖u₀ 0 (R x)‖ ≤ M` follows immediately from `hMu (R x)`. The
  isometry hypothesis on `R` is not actually used in the proof
  (the bounded-amplitude predicate only cares about reindexing,
  not norm preservation); it is in the signature to keep the
  symmetry-group flavour honest. Once `HasFiniteEnergy` is upgraded
  to the real L² bound `‖u₀(0,·)‖_{L²} < ∞`, the isometry
  hypothesis WILL become load-bearing (change-of-variables under
  an orthogonal map preserves Lebesgue measure exactly because
  `|det R| = 1`).

  **Honest scoping reminder.** This does NOT advance the NS tower
  past `Status: Open` (see `docs/ROADMAP.md` § 3). `HasFiniteEnergy`
  is still the Task #51 placeholder (bounded amplitude at `t = 0`),
  not the L² energy bound. Rotational invariance of the
  *placeholder* predicate is not rotational invariance of the real
  energy. The brick exercises real PDE-flavoured surface vocabulary
  (Euclidean symmetry group SO(3)) on a placeholder schema,
  nothing more.

  Axiom-footprint contract (per `scripts/check-towers.sh`): the
  theorem must be either axiom-free or use only the classical trio
  `{propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound}`.

/-- **Rotational invariance of placeholder finite-energy.**
    If `u₀` has finite placeholder energy with witness `M`, then for
    any linear isometry `R` of `ℝ³` the rotated field
    `fun t x => u₀ t (R x)` also has finite placeholder energy with
    the *same* witness `M`. References the Task #51 schema def
    `HasFiniteEnergy` and is a genuine PDE-flavoured combinator
    (rigid spatial rotation under the full Euclidean symmetry group
    SO(3) — actually any linear isometry, hence O(3)). NOT a
    statement about the L² energy bound or any Leray-Hopf solution;
    this is closure of the *placeholder* predicate under spatial
    rotation. The isometry hypothesis is in the signature for
    honesty (it becomes load-bearing once `HasFiniteEnergy` is
    upgraded to the real L² bound). -/
