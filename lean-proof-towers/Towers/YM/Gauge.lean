  **This file does NOT prove the Yang-Mills mass gap or any energy
  bound.** It establishes the most-trivial-possible gauge-action
  identity on a single-point trivial bundle and pins the Clay
  mass-gap statement schema as a future target. The single-point
  trivial bundle is NOT a physically meaningful Yang-Mills
  configuration.

  Status (cf. `docs/ROADMAP.md` § 2. Yang-Mills mass gap):

  - `TrivialConfiguration G`         — a single-field structure
                                        carrying just the value of a
                                        "connection" at the single
                                        base point of a trivial
                                        principal `G`-bundle over a
                                        point. **Honesty note:** a
                                        real Yang-Mills connection is
                                        a Lie-algebra-valued 1-form
                                        on a principal bundle; this
                                        encoding is a placeholder
                                        scaffold, not a physical
                                        configuration.
  - `instance : MulAction G (TrivialConfiguration G)`
                                     — the gauge action of `G` on
                                        configurations by left
                                        multiplication on the carried
                                        value.
  - `gauge_action_one_smul`          — trivial identity-acts-trivially
                                        lemma, **proved** by delegating
                                        to mathlib's `one_smul`. Axiom
                                        footprint = subset of mathlib's
                                        classical core
                                        `{propext, Classical.choice,
                                        Quot.sound}`, no research-grade
                                        axioms. (Verified by
                                        `scripts/check-towers.sh`.)
  - `YangMillsMassGap_statement`     — **statement only.** A schema
                                        for the Clay Yang-Mills mass-gap
                                        conjecture, expressed in terms
                                        of opaque placeholder
                                        predicates. Closing it is the
                                        open Clay Millennium Problem.

  **Honest scoping reminder.** This file does **not** advance the YM
  tower past `Status: Open` (see `docs/ROADMAP.md` § 2). It moves YM
  from `Status: Open` to `Status: Open — first brick formalized
  (gauge-action identity in Lean, axiom footprint ⊆ classical trio)`.
  No promotion past `Open`. No claim of any QFT result.

/-- **Trivial-bundle configuration.** A "connection" on the trivial
    principal `G`-bundle over a single point is just a choice of
    element of `G` at that one base point.

    **Honesty note.** A real Yang-Mills connection is a
    Lie-algebra-valued 1-form on a principal bundle over (at least)
    a 4-manifold. This single-field structure is a scaffold for a
    brick name, not a physically meaningful Yang-Mills configuration.
    Future plans must replace this with the real bundle/connection
    machinery once mathlib v4.12.0+ provides it (principal bundles,
    connections, curvature 2-forms, Yang-Mills functional). -/

/-- The **gauge action** of `G` on `TrivialConfiguration G` is by
    left multiplication on the carried value: a gauge transformation
    `g : G` sends the configuration carrying `A : G` to the
    configuration carrying `g * A`. -/

end TrivialConfiguration

/-- **Identity gauge transformation acts trivially (trivial brick).**

    For any topological group `G` and any configuration
    `A : TrivialConfiguration G`, the identity gauge transformation
    `(1 : G)` fixes `A`:

      `(1 : G) • A = A`.

    The proof is a one-line delegation to mathlib's `one_smul` on
    the `MulAction` instance above. This lemma is **not** new
    mathematics — it is the `MulAction.one_smul` axiom of any
    group action, re-named in the Yang-Mills context so future
    YM plans have a stable hook to invoke instead of dropping into
    the raw `MulAction` API.

    Axiom footprint: subset of mathlib's classical core
    `{propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound}` (verified by
    `scripts/check-towers.sh`). No research-grade axioms; in
    particular this lemma does **not** depend on any of the
    placeholder axioms `PhysicalStateOfYangMillsHamiltonian`,
    `IsAboveVacuum`, `expectedEnergy`, or `normSq` declared below
    for the mass-gap schema. -/

/-- Placeholder for "the type of physical (normalisable) states of
    the constructive 4D Yang-Mills Hamiltonian on `ℝ⁴` (or on a
    spatial slice `ℝ³`)".

    **TODO** (open mathlib-scale work, separate from the mass gap
    itself): replace this axiom with the real Hilbert space of
    physical states once mathlib v4.12.0+ provides the
    Wightman/Osterwalder-Schrader axiomatic QFT framework and a
    constructive 4D Yang-Mills Hamiltonian.

    Declared as a fresh axiom (not as `def ... := Unit` or
    `def ... := Empty`) so that `YangMillsMassGap_statement` below
    is not closeable or refutable by instantiating this type
    trivially. -/
axiom PhysicalStateOfYangMillsHamiltonian : Type

/-- Placeholder for "the state `ψ` is strictly above the vacuum
    state of the Yang-Mills Hamiltonian". In the real theory, this
    is the orthogonality-to-vacuum condition required for the mass
    gap to be a meaningful lower bound.

    **TODO**: replace with the real orthogonality / above-vacuum
    condition once we have a real Hamiltonian.

    Declared as a fresh axiom for the same reason as
    `PhysicalStateOfYangMillsHamiltonian`. -/
axiom IsAboveVacuum : PhysicalStateOfYangMillsHamiltonian → Prop

/-- Placeholder for `‖ψ‖²`, the squared norm of a physical state in
    the Yang-Mills Hilbert space.

    **TODO**: replace with the real `‖ψ‖²_H` once the Hilbert space
    of physical states is defined.

    Declared as a fresh axiom for the same reason as
    `PhysicalStateOfYangMillsHamiltonian`. -/
axiom normSq : PhysicalStateOfYangMillsHamiltonian → ℝ

/-- Placeholder for `⟨ψ | H | ψ⟩`, the expected energy of a physical
    state under the Yang-Mills Hamiltonian.

    **TODO**: replace with the real `⟨ψ, H ψ⟩` once the Hamiltonian
    is defined.

    Declared as a fresh axiom for the same reason as
    `PhysicalStateOfYangMillsHamiltonian`. -/
axiom expectedEnergy : PhysicalStateOfYangMillsHamiltonian → ℝ

/-- **Statement** of the Clay Yang-Mills mass-gap conjecture,
    expressed in terms of the placeholder axioms
    `PhysicalStateOfYangMillsHamiltonian`, `IsAboveVacuum`,
    `normSq`, and `expectedEnergy`.

    Classical form (see Jaffe-Witten, *Quantum Yang-Mills theory*,
    Clay Mathematics Institute Millennium Problem description,
    2000): for any compact simple gauge group, the constructive 4D
    Yang-Mills quantum field theory on `ℝ⁴` exists and exhibits a
    mass gap `Δ > 0` — i.e. the spectrum of the Hamiltonian above
    the vacuum is bounded below by `Δ`.

    Schema form below: there exists a real `Δ > 0` such that for
    every physical state `ψ` above the vacuum,
    `Δ · ‖ψ‖² ≤ ⟨ψ | H | ψ⟩`.

    **Statement schema only. Mathlib v4.12.0 does not have
    constructive 4D Yang-Mills quantum field theory or the
    Wightman/OS framework; the placeholder predicates are honest
    stand-ins that future plans must replace with the real QFT
    machinery. Do not close with `True.intro`, `trivial`, `sorry`,
    or any tautology.** With the four placeholder axioms above
    declared as opaque constants, this schema is not closeable by
    any structural trick — proving or refuting it would require new
    axioms about the placeholders (and the surrounding
    `check-towers.sh` axiom-footprint check would catch any such
    misuse on a derived theorem).

    Proving this — or even stating it precisely — requires both the
    Wightman/OS axiomatic QFT framework and a constructive 4D
    Yang-Mills Hamiltonian in mathlib (open mathlib-scale work) and
    the Clay-YM mass-gap proof itself (a Clay Millennium Problem,
    open since 2000). The schema below is the *future target*, not
    a theorem. -/
